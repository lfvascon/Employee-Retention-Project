# Employee-Retention-Project
Salifort Motors is looking to improve employee retention, so let's provide data-driven suggestions for HR.
## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive data-driven initiative aimed at optimizing employee retention at Salifort Motors. The project involves leveraging logistic regression and tree-based machine learning models, specifically comparing the performance of decision tree and random forest models. By analyzing relevant factors influencing employee turnover, the project aims to provide actionable insights to the HR department for effective retention strategies.
## Business Understanding
Salifort Motors recognizes the importance of retaining top talent for sustained growth and success. The project aims to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover by analyzing historical data. By understanding the drivers behind attrition, the HR department can implement targeted strategies to improve workplace satisfaction, career development, and overall employee experience.
## Data Understanding
The project will delve into Salifort Motors' employee dataset, encompassing variables such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, career advancement opportunities, compensation, and other relevant factors. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be conducted to uncover patterns and correlations. This phase will guide feature selection and preprocessing strategies to prepare the data for modeling.
## Modeling and Evaluation
Two primary models will be implemented: logistic regression and a tree-based model, with a focus on decision tree and random forest. These models will predict the likelihood of employee churn based on the identified features. The random forest model will be evaluated against the decision tree to determine the best-performing model. Evaluation metrics will include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The random forest model, as indicated, is expected to slightly outperform the decision tree. This comparative analysis will provide insights into the robustness and effectiveness of each model in predicting employee retention.
## Conclusion
The models and the feature importances extracted from the models confirm that employees at the company are overworked. 

To retain employees, the following recommendations could be presented to the stakeholders:

* Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.
* Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for atleast four years, or conduct further investigation about why four-year tenured employees are so dissatisfied. 
* Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so. 
* If employees aren't familiar with the company's overtime pay policies, inform them about this. If the expectations around workload and time off aren't explicit, make them clear. 
* Hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts. 
* High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort.
